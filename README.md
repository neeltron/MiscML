# MiscML

MiscML is a python based GUI tool, that allows beginners to perform Machine Learning with ease and visualizes the results.

For the starters, we're planning to have the following algorithms in MiscML:

<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression </li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li>K-NN</li>
  <li>Naive Bayes</li>
</ul>
<hr>
UI is currently under development!
